## My first repository
## My project

For my project, I will analyze the `AID_743085_datatable_all.csv` data in `info550temp` file. 

No packages need to be installed.



## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run 

``` bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('project.rmd')"
```

This will create a file called `project.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
